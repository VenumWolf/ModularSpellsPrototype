/**
 * Provides tracking and updating for custom {@link SpellProjectile}s.

 *
 * In order for {@link SpellProjectile}s to work as intended, ProjectileSystem should be scheduled to run every tick.
 * This can be done as such:
 *
 * <code>
 * projectileSystem = new ProjectileSystem();
 * projectileSystem.runTaskTimer(plugin, 0 , 1);
 * </code>
 *
 * There should ideally be only one ProjectileSystem per plugin. Because ProjectileSystem is immutable, it is safe
