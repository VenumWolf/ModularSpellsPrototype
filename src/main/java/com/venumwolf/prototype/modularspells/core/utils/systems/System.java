/**
 * A facade for self-starting and self-stopping bundles of related functionality (the event-listeners, tasks,
 * config files, ext. required to make a feature tick.)
 *
 * <br>
 *
 * The main motivation for System is to provide a single place complex initialization and tear-down logic for related
 * pieces of functionality.
 *
 * Systems should have their dependencies injected in the constructor, then they can be started and stopped with a
 * single method call.
 *
 * <b>Ex.</b>
 *
 * <code>
 *  System someSystem;
 *
 *  public void onEnable() {
 *      someSystem = new SomeSystem(dep1, dep2, ext);
 *      someSystem.start();
 *  }
 *
 *  public void onDisable() {
 *      someSystem.stop();
 *  }
 * </code>
