# Modular Spells (Prototype)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/VenumWolf/ModularSpellsPrototype.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/VenumWolf/ModularSpellsPrototype)

Modular Spells is a magic plugin for Minecraft Paper servers adding a component-based magic system.  Players create and 
customize their own magic spells by combining spell pages (components) in their spell book.  Each page contributes a 
unique effect or behavior to the final spell, and players are encouraged to experiment with different combinations to
create spells which suit their play style.  Crafting powerful spells is not without risk, however. Magicians must take 
care not to exceed their own abilities, or the capabilities of their wands lest they suffer the consequences.

This prototype implements a simple TDM / FFA mini-game featuring the pluggable magic system as a proof-of-concept.
